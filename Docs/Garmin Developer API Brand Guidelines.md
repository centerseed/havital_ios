AUTHENTICATING APPLICATIONS
When presenting to customers or authenticating an application that integrates with an official Garmin app, use the full app name and tile to display the connection. Do not abbreviate,
truncate or stylize the Garmin app name.
These guidelines are designed to help developers represent the Garmin brand accurately and responsibly while enabling
seamless, meaningful connections between the developers’ platforms and Garmin products.
Garmin creates purpose-built products with sensors that capture data that is meaningful to our customers. By following
the Garmin API brand guidelines, developers will:
All developers must adhere to their applicable Garmin developer program license agreement along with the Garmin API brand guidelines.
COMMUNICATING USE OF GARMIN DEVICE-SOURCED DATA OR APPS Garmin apps should be communicated in marketing materials by using both the badge
icon and messaging around its usage. A qualified designer should determine placement
within materials, including websites, catalogs, advertisements and more.
SAMPLE MESSAGING The Garmin Connect™ app is your one-stop source for health and fitness data.
Get detailed nautical charts with the Navionics® Boating app.
Download watch faces and apps at the Connect IQ™ Store.
SAMPLE MESSAGING Acceptable: This chart was created using data provided by Garmin devices.
Acceptable: Insights derived in part from Garmin device-sourced data.
Acceptable: Model incorporates Garmin [device model] data.
Not acceptable: Garmin speed model.
TITLE-LEVEL OR PRIMARY DISPLAYS
All uses of Garmin device-sourced data within dashboards, activity feeds, overview cards or summary views must include a “Garmin [device model]” attribution. This attribution ensures
brand clarity and traceability. Access the device model information as instructed in the applicable API documentation. If the device model is not provided or unknown via the API, list
Garmin as the data source.
REQUIREMENTS Position the Garmin attribution directly beneath or adjacent to the primary title or heading
of the data view. The listing must be placed above the fold and always be visually
associated with the data it supports, both in real-time views and exported visuals. Never
bury the Garmin attribution in tooltips, footnotes or expandable containers.
The attribution can include the Garmin tag logo followed by the device model or simply
be listed in appropriately sized text: “Garmin [device model].” If using the Garmin tag logo,
access the files and follow the usage requirements in our Consumer Brand Style Guide.
Do not alter or animate the Garmin tag logo. Do not use the Garmin tag logo in avatars,
badges or unrelated imagery. Do not use the Garmin tag logo in instances where Garmin
device-sourced data is not present.
SECONDARY SCREENS
All uses of Garmin device-sourced data within detailed data views, reports, settings or historical views must include a “Garmin [device model]” attribution. This includes data views that
display information such as heart rate, steps, Body Battery™ energy monitoring, etc. This attribution ensures brand clarity and traceability. Access the device model information as
instructed in the applicable API documentation. If the device model is not provided or is unknown via the API, list Garmin as the data source.
REQUIREMENTS
GARMIN MARINE MAPPING EXAMPLE
List the Garmin attribution in all expanded views or subscreens. For multi-entry displays,
you can apply the attribution globally — such as in a header — or per entry. Screenshots,
printouts and reports must retain visible Garmin attribution.
The attribution can include the Garmin tag logo followed by the device model or simply
be listed in appropriately sized text: “Garmin [device model].” If using the Garmin tag logo,
access the files and follow the usage requirements in our Consumer Brand Style Guide.
Do not alter or animate the Garmin tag logo. Do not use the Garmin tag logo in avatars,
badges or unrelated imagery. Do not use the Garmin tag logo in instances where Garmin
device-sourced data is not present.
DOWNSTREAM AND EXPORTED DATA
All commercial uses of Garmin device-sourced data that is shared, exported or transmitted beyond an application must include a Garmin attribution. This includes sharing data via file
formats (such as CSVs or PDFs) or digital interfaces (such as APIs or webhooks). It is the developer’s responsibility to enforce downstream attribution in systems beyond its control
through technical measures or contractual terms.
REQUIREMENTS Include the Garmin attribution with the data listing at all times. In exports, the attribution
must be adjacent to the data and repeated on each page. In APIs or webhook transfers,
receiving systems must preserve attribution, and this should be outlined in a partner
sublicense. In third-party visualizations, social media sharing or embedded experiences,
the attribution must always remain visible. For multi-entry displays, you can apply the
attribution globally — such as in a header or footer — or per entry.
COMBINED OR DERIVED DATA
All uses of Garmin device-sourced data as an input to analytics, algorithms, machine learning models, artificial intelligence or combined, aggregated or blended with other sources —
such as fitness apps, devices, third-party APIs or manual inputs — must include a Garmin attribution. This includes any use where the output is influenced materially by Garmin
device-sourced data.
REQUIREMENTS The attribution must list Garmin as a distinct or contributing data source (depending
on what is true) and must not imply Garmin endorsement of data from other devices.
For multi-entry displays, you can apply the attribution globally — such as in a header or
footer — or per entry.
VISUAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA
All uses of Garmin device-sourced data as exports from third-party platforms into visual assets, such as social media images, infographics, maps or charts, must include a “Garmin [device
model]” attribution. This attribution ensures brand clarity and traceability. Access the device model information as instructed in the applicable API documentation. If the device model is not
provided or unknown via the API, list Garmin as the data source.
REQUIREMENTS The Garmin attribution must be visible in every image.
The attribution can include the Garmin tag logo followed by the device model or simply
be listed in appropriately sized text: “Garmin [device model].” If using the Garmin tag logo,
access the files and follow the usage requirements in our Consumer Brand Style Guide.
Do not alter or animate the Garmin tag logo. Do not use the Garmin tag logo in avatars,
badges or unrelated imagery. Do not use the Garmin tag logo in instances where Garmin
device-sourced data is not present.
GARMIN RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REVIEW APPLICATIONS FOR ATTRIBUTION COMPLIANCE. NONCOMPLIANCE MAY RESULT IN SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF API ACCESS. REFER TO THE APPLICABLE GARMIN DEVELOPER PROGRAM LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR MORE DETAIL.
